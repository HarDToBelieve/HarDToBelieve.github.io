     * Called to change one of the various levelled mechanisms in
     * the listing generator. LIST_INCLUDE and LIST_MACRO can be
     * used to increase the nesting level of include files and
     * macro expansions; LIST_TIMES and LIST_INCBIN switch on the
     * two binary-output-suppression mechanisms for large-scale
     * pseudo-instructions.
     *
     * LIST_MACRO_NOLIST is synonymous with LIST_MACRO except that
     * it indicates the beginning of the expansion of a `nolist&apos;
     * macro, so anything under that level won&apos;t be expanded unless
     * it includes another file.
