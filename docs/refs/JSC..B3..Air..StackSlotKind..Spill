    // They are lowered to from temporaries. This means for example that a 32-bit ZDef store to a
    // 8 byte stack slot will zero the top 4 bytes, even though a 32-bit ZDef store to any other
    // kind of memory location would do no such thing. UseAddr on a spill slot is not allowed, so
    // they never escape.</doc>
