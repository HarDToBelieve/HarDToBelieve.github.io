<doc f='webkit/Source/JavaScriptCore/dfg/DFGBasicBlock.h' l='214'>// The intersection of assumptions we have made previously at the head of this block. Note
    // that under normal circumstances, each time we run the CFA, we will get strictly more precise
    // results. But we don&apos;t actually require this to be the case. It&apos;s fine for the CFA to loosen
    // up for any odd reason. It&apos;s fine when this happens, because anything that the CFA proves
    // must be true from that point forward, except if some registered watchpoint fires, in which
    // case the code won&apos;t ever run. So, the CFA proving something less precise later on is just an
    // outcome of the CFA being imperfect; the more precise thing that it had proved earlier is no
    // less true.
    //
    // But for the purpose of OSR entry, we need to make sure that we remember what assumptions we
    // had used for optimizing any given basic block. That&apos;s what this is for.
    //
    // It&apos;s interesting that we could use this to make the CFA more precise: all future CFAs could
    // filter their results with this thing to sort of maintain maximal precision. Because we
    // expect CFA to usually be monotonically more precise each time we run it to fixpoint, this
    // would not be a productive optimization: it would make setting up a basic block more
    // expensive and would only benefit bizarre pathological cases.</doc>
