@typedef JSObjectInitializeCallback
@abstract The callback invoked when an object is first created.
@param ctx The execution context to use.
@param object The JSObject being created.
@discussion If you named your function Initialize, you would declare it like this:

void Initialize(JSContextRef ctx, JSObjectRef object);

Unlike the other object callbacks, the initialize callback is called on the least
derived class (the parent class) first, and the most derived class last.
