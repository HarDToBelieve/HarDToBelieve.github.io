// negotiated on the client. This callback must be set to enable PSK cipher
// suites on the client.
//
// The callback is passed the identity hint in |hint| or NULL if none was
// provided. It should select a PSK identity and write the identity and the
// corresponding PSK to |identity| and |psk|, respectively. The identity is
// written as a NUL-terminated C string of length (excluding the NUL terminator)
// at most |max_identity_len|. The PSK&apos;s length must be at most |max_psk_len|.
// The callback returns the length of the PSK or 0 if no suitable identity was
// found.</doc>
