 * This is the internal form which we break input lines up into.
 * Typically stored in linked lists.
 *
 * Note that `type&apos; serves a double meaning: TOK_SMAC_PARAM is not
 * necessarily used as-is, but is intended to denote the number of
 * the substituted parameter. So in the definition
 *
 *     %define a(x,y) ( (x) &amp; ~(y) )
 * 
 * the token representing `x&apos; will have its type changed to
 * TOK_SMAC_PARAM, but the one representing `y&apos; will be
 * TOK_SMAC_PARAM+1.
 *
 * TOK_INTERNAL_STRING is a dirty hack: it&apos;s a single string token
 * which doesn&apos;t need quotes around it. Used in the pre-include
 * mechanism as an alternative to trying to find a sensible type of
 * quote to use on the filename we were passed.
