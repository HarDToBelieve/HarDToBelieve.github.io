@enum WebCacheModel

@abstract Specifies a usage model for a WebView, which WebKit will use to 
determine its caching behavior.

@constant WebCacheModelDocumentViewer Appropriate for a WebView displaying 
a fixed document -- like a splash screen, a chat document, or a word processing 
document -- with no UI for navigation. The WebView will behave like any other 
view, releasing resources when they are no longer referenced. Remote resources, 
if any, will be cached to disk. This is the most memory-efficient setting.

Examples: iChat, Mail, TextMate, Growl.

@constant WebCacheModelDocumentBrowser Appropriate for a WebView displaying 
a browsable series of documents with a UI for navigating between them -- for 
example, a reference materials browser or a website designer. The WebView will 
cache a reasonable number of resources and previously viewed documents in 
memory and/or on disk.

Examples: Dictionary, Help Viewer, Coda.

@constant WebCacheModelPrimaryWebBrowser Appropriate for a WebView in the 
application that acts as the user&apos;s primary web browser. The WebView will cache
a very large number of resources and previously viewed documents in memory 
and/or on disk.

Examples: Safari, OmniWeb, Shiira.
