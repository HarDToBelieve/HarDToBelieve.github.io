    @class WebHTMLView
    @discussion A document view of WebFrameView that displays HTML content.
    WebHTMLView is a NSControl because it hosts NSCells that are painted by WebCore&apos;s Aqua theme
    renderer (and those cells must be hosted by an enclosing NSControl in order to paint properly).
