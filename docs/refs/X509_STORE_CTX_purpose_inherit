 * This function is used to set the X509_STORE_CTX purpose and trust values.
 * This is intended to be used when another structure has its own trust and
 * purpose values which (if set) will be inherited by the ctx. If they aren&apos;t
 * set then we will usually have a default purpose in mind which should then
 * be used to set the trust value. An example of this is SSL use: an SSL
 * structure will have its own purpose and trust settings which the
 * application can set: if they aren&apos;t set then we use the default of SSL
 * client/server.
