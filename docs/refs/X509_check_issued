 * Various checks to see if one certificate issued the second. This can be
 * used to prune a set of possible issuer certificates which have been looked
 * up using some simple method such as by subject name. These are: 1. Check
 * issuer_name(subject) == subject_name(issuer) 2. If akid(subject) exists

 * certificate signing returns 0 for OK, positive for reason for mismatch,
