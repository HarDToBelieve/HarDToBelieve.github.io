<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/abseil-cpp/absl/base/internal/raw_logging.h' l='66'>// ABSL_INTERNAL_LOG and ABSL_INTERNAL_CHECK work like the RAW variants above,
// except that if the richer log library is linked into the binary, we dispatch
// to that instead.  This is potentially useful for internal logging and
// assertions, where we are using RAW_LOG neither for its async-signal-safety
// nor for its non-allocating nature, but rather because raw logging has very
// few other dependencies.
//
// The API is a subset of the above: each macro only takes two arguments.  Use
// StrCat if you need to build a richer message.</doc>
