<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/bytestring.h' l='157'>// Parsing ASN.1
//
// |CBS| may be used to parse DER structures. Rather than using a schema
// compiler, the following functions act on tag-length-value elements in the
// serialization itself. Thus the caller is responsible for looping over a
// SEQUENCE, branching on CHOICEs or OPTIONAL fields, checking for trailing
// data, and handling explict vs. implicit tagging.
//
// Tags are represented as |unsigned| values in memory. The upper few bits store
// the class and constructed bit, and the remaining bits store the tag
// number. Note this differs from the DER serialization, to support tag numbers
// beyond 31. Consumers must use the constants defined below to decompose or
// assemble tags.
//
// This library treats an element&apos;s constructed bit as part of its tag. In DER,
// the constructed bit is computable from the type. The constants for universal
// types have the bit set. Callers must set it correctly for tagged types.
// Explicitly-tagged types are always constructed, and implicitly-tagged types
// inherit the underlying type&apos;s bit.

// CBS_ASN1_TAG_SHIFT is how much the in-memory representation shifts the class
// and constructed bits from the DER serialization.</doc>
