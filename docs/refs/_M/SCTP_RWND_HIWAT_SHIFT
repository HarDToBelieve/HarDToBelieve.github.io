 * Threshold for rwnd updates, we have to read (sb_hiwat &gt;&gt;
 * SCTP_RWND_HIWAT_SHIFT) before we will look to see if we need to send a
 * window update sack. When we look, we compare the last rwnd we sent vs the
 * current rwnd. It too must be greater than this value. Using 3 divdes the
 * hiwat by 8, so for 200k rwnd we need to read 24k. For a 64k rwnd we need
 * to read 8k. This seems about right.. I hope :-D.. we do set a
 * min of a MTU on it so if the rwnd is real small we will insist
 * on a full MTU of 1500 bytes.
