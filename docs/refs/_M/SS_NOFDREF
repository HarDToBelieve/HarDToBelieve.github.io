 * Socket state bits.
 *
 * Historically, this bits were all kept in the so_state field.  For
 * locking reasons, they are now in multiple fields, as they are
 * locked differently.  so_state maintains basic socket state protected
 * by the socket lock.  so_qstate holds information about the socket
 * accept queues.  Each socket buffer also has a state field holding
 * information relevant to that socket buffer (can&apos;t send, rcv).  Many
 * fields will be read without locks to improve performance and avoid
 * lock order issues.  However, this approach must be used with caution.
