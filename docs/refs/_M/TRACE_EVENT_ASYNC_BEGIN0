<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/ANGLE/src/third_party/trace_event/trace_event.h' l='298'>// Records a single ASYNC_BEGIN event called &quot;name&quot; immediately, with 0, 1 or 2
// associated arguments. If the category is not enabled, then this
// does nothing.
// - category and name strings must have application lifetime (statics or
//   literals). They may not include &quot; chars.
// - |id| is used to match the ASYNC_BEGIN event with the ASYNC_END event. ASYNC
//   events are considered to match if their category, name and id values all
//   match. |id| must either be a pointer or an integer value up to 64 bits. If
//   it&apos;s a pointer, the bits will be xored with a hash of the process ID so
//   that the same pointer on two different processes will not collide.
// An asynchronous operation can consist of multiple phases. The first phase is
// defined by the ASYNC_BEGIN calls. Additional phases can be defined using the
// ASYNC_STEP_BEGIN macros. When the operation completes, call ASYNC_END.
// An async operation can span threads and processes, but all events in that
// operation must use the same |name| and |id|. Each event can have its own
// args.</doc>
