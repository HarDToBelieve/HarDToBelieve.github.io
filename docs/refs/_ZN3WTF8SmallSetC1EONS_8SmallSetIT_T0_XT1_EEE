<doc f='webkit/WebKitBuild/Debug/usr/local/include/wtf/SmallSet.h' l='58'>// We take care to have SmallSet have partial move semantics allowable through
    // memcpy. It&apos;s partial move semantics because our destructor should not be called
    // on the SmallPtrObject in the old memory we were moved from (otherwise, we might free m_buffer twice)
    // unless that old memory is reset to be isSmall(). See move constructor below.
    // To maintain these semantics, we determine if we&apos;re small by checking our size
    // and not our m_buffer pointer. And when we&apos;re small, we don&apos;t do operations on
    // m_buffer, instead, we perform operations on m_smallStorage directly. The reason we want
    // these semantics is that it&apos;s beneficial to have a Vector that contains SmallSet
    // (or an object with SmallSet as a field) be allowed to use memcpy for its move operation.</doc>
