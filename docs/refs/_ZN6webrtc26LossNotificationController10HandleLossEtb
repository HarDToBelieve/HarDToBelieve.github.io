<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/webrtc/modules/video_coding/loss_notification_controller.h' l='55'>// When the loss of a packet or the non-decodability of a frame is detected,
  // produces a key frame request or a loss notification.
  // 1. |last_received_seq_num| is the last received sequence number.
  // 2. |decodability_flag| refers to the frame associated with the last packet.
  //    It is set to |true| if and only if all of that frame&apos;s dependencies are
  //    known to be decodable, and the frame itself is not yet known to be
  //    unassemblable (i.e. no earlier parts of it were lost).
  //    Clarifications:
  //    a. In a multi-packet frame, the first packet reveals the frame&apos;s
  //       dependencies, but it is not yet known whether all parts of the
  //       current frame will be received.
  //    b. In a multi-packet frame, if the first packet is missed, the
  //       dependencies are unknown, but it is known that the frame itself
  //       is unassemblable.</doc>
