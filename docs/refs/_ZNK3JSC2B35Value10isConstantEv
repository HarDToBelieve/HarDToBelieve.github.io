<doc f='webkit/Source/JavaScriptCore/b3/B3Value.h' l='197'>// What follows are a bunch of helpers for inspecting and modifying values. Note that we have a
    // bunch of different idioms for implementing such helpers. You can use virtual methods, and
    // override from the various Value subclasses. You can put the method inside Value and make it
    // non-virtual, and the implementation can switch on kind. The method could be inline or not.
    // If a method is specific to some Value subclass, you could put it in the subclass, or you could
    // put it on Value anyway. It&apos;s fine to pick whatever feels right, and we shouldn&apos;t restrict
    // ourselves to any particular idiom.</doc>
