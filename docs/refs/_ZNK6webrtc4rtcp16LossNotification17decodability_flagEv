<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/webrtc/modules/rtp_rtcp/source/rtcp_packet/loss_notification.h' l='60'>// A decodability flag, whose specific meaning depends on the last-received
  // RTP sequence number. The decodability flag is true if and only if all of
  // the frame&apos;s dependencies are known to be decodable, and the frame itself
  // is not yet known to be unassemblable.
  // * Clarification #1: In a multi-packet frame, the first packet&apos;s
  //   dependencies are known, but it is not yet known whether all parts
  //   of the current frame will be received.
  // * Clarification #2: In a multi-packet frame, the dependencies would be
  //   unknown if the first packet was not received. Then, the packet will
  //   be known-unassemblable.</doc>
