 * @brief srtp_crypto_policy_set_null_cipher_hmac_null() sets a crypto
 * policy structure to use no encryption or authentication.
 *
 * @param p is a pointer to the policy structure to be set
 *
 * The function call srtp_crypto_policy_set_null_cipher_hmac_null(&amp;p)
 * sets the srtp_crypto_policy_t at location p to use no encryption and
 * no authentication.  This policy should only be used for testing and
 * troubleshooting.
 *
 * This function is a convenience that helps to avoid dealing directly
 * with the policy data structure.  You are encouraged to initialize
 * policy elements with this function call.  Doing so may allow your
 * code to be forward compatible with later versions of libSRTP that
 * include more elements in the srtp_crypto_policy_t datatype.
 *
 * @warning This policy is NOT RECOMMENDED for SRTP unless there is a
 * requirement to forgo encryption and authentication.
 *
 * @return void.
