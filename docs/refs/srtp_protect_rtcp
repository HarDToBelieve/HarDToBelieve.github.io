 * @brief srtp_protect_rtcp() is the Secure RTCP sender-side packet
 * processing function.
 *
 * The function call srtp_protect_rtcp(ctx, rtp_hdr, len_ptr) applies
 * SRTCP protection to the RTCP packet rtcp_hdr (which has length
 * *len_ptr) using the SRTP session context ctx.  If srtp_err_status_ok is
 * returned, then rtp_hdr points to the resulting SRTCP packet and
 * *len_ptr is the number of octets in that packet; otherwise, no
 * assumptions should be made about the value of either data elements.
 *
 * @warning This function assumes that it can write the authentication
 * tag into the location in memory immediately following the RTCP
 * packet, and assumes that the RTCP packet is aligned on a 32-bit
 * boundary.
 *
 * @warning This function assumes that it can write SRTP_MAX_TRAILER_LEN+4
 * into the location in memory immediately following the RTCP packet.
 * Callers MUST ensure that this much writable memory is available in
 * the buffer that holds the RTCP packet.
 *
 * @param ctx is the SRTP context to use in processing the packet.
 *
 * @param rtcp_hdr is a pointer to the RTCP packet (before the call); after
 * the function returns, it points to the srtp packet.
 *
 * @param pkt_octet_len is a pointer to the length in octets of the
 * complete RTCP packet (header and body) before the function call,
 * and of the complete SRTCP packet after the call, if srtp_err_status_ok
 * was returned.  Otherwise, the value of the data to which it points
 * is undefined.
 *
 * @return
 *    - srtp_err_status_ok            if there were no problems.
 *    - [other]                  if there was a failure in
 *                               the cryptographic mechanisms.
