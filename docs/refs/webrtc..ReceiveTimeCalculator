<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/webrtc/call/receive_time_calculator.h' l='34'>// The receive time calculator serves the purpose of combining packet time
// stamps with a safely incremental clock. This assumes that the packet time
// stamps are based on lower layer timestamps that have more accurate time
// increments since they are based on the exact receive time. They might
// however, have large jumps due to clock resets in the system. To compensate
// this they are combined with a safe clock source that is guaranteed to be
// consistent, but it will not be able to measure the exact time when a packet
// is received.</doc>
