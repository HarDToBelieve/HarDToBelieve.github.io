     * the data; the data type. Data types are similar to the
     * output-format interface, only OUT_ADDRESS will _always_ be
     * displayed as if it&apos;s relocatable, so ensure that any non-
     * relocatable address has been converted to OUT_RAWDATA by
     * then. Note that OUT_RAWDATA+0 is a valid data type, and is a
     * dummy call used to give the listing generator an offset to
     * work with when doing things like uplevel(LIST_TIMES) or
     * uplevel(LIST_INCBIN).
