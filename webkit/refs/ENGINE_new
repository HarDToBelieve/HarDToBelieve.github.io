<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/engine.h' l='25'>// Engines are collections of methods. Methods are tables of function pointers,
// defined for certain algorithms, that allow operations on those algorithms to
// be overridden via a callback. This can be used, for example, to implement an
// RSA* that forwards operations to a hardware module.
//
// Methods are reference counted but |ENGINE|s are not. When creating a method,
// you should zero the whole structure and fill in the function pointers that
// you wish before setting it on an |ENGINE|. Any functions pointers that
// are NULL indicate that the default behaviour should be used.


// Allocation and destruction.

// ENGINE_new returns an empty ENGINE that uses the default method for all
// algorithms.</doc>
