//
// The ALPS extension (draft-vvv-tls-alps) allows exchanging application-layer
// settings in the TLS handshake for applications negotiated with ALPN. Note
// that, when ALPS is negotiated, the client and server each advertise their own
// settings, so there are functions to both configure setting to send and query
// received settings.

// SSL_add_application_settings configures |ssl| to enable ALPS with ALPN
// protocol |proto|, sending an ALPS value of |settings|. It returns one on
// success and zero on error. If |proto| is negotiated via ALPN and the peer
// supports ALPS, |settings| will be sent to the peer. The peer&apos;s ALPS value can
// be retrieved with |SSL_get0_peer_application_settings|.
//
// On the client, this function should be called before the handshake, once for
// each supported ALPN protocol which uses ALPS. |proto| must be included in the
// client&apos;s ALPN configuration (see |SSL_CTX_set_alpn_protos| and
// |SSL_set_alpn_protos|). On the server, ALPS can be preconfigured for each
// protocol as in the client, or configuration can be deferred to the ALPN
// callback (see |SSL_CTX_set_alpn_select_cb|), in which case only the selected
// protocol needs to be configured.
//
// ALPS can be independently configured from 0-RTT, however changes in protocol
// settings will fallback to 1-RTT to negotiate the new value, so it is
// recommended for |settings| to be relatively stable.</doc>
