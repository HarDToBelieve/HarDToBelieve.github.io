<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/ssl.h' l='250'>// SSL_set_bio configures |ssl| to read from |rbio| and write to |wbio|. |ssl|
// takes ownership of the two |BIO|s. If |rbio| and |wbio| are the same, |ssl|
// only takes ownership of one reference.
//
// In DTLS, |rbio| must be non-blocking to properly handle timeouts and
// retransmits.
//
// If |rbio| is the same as the currently configured |BIO| for reading, that
// side is left untouched and is not freed.
//
// If |wbio| is the same as the currently configured |BIO| for writing AND |ssl|
// is not currently configured to read from and write to the same |BIO|, that
// side is left untouched and is not freed. This asymmetry is present for
// historical reasons.
//
// Due to the very complex historical behavior of this function, calling this
// function if |ssl| already has |BIO|s configured is deprecated. Prefer
// |SSL_set0_rbio| and |SSL_set0_wbio| instead.</doc>
