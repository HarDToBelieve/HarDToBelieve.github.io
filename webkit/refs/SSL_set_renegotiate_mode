<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/ssl.h' l='3993'>// SSL_set_renegotiate_mode configures how |ssl|, a client, reacts to
// renegotiation attempts by a server. If |ssl| is a server, peer-initiated
// renegotiations are *always* rejected and this function does nothing.
//
// The renegotiation mode defaults to |ssl_renegotiate_never|, but may be set
// at any point in a connection&apos;s lifetime. Set it to |ssl_renegotiate_once| to
// allow one renegotiation, |ssl_renegotiate_freely| to allow all
// renegotiations or |ssl_renegotiate_ignore| to ignore HelloRequest messages.
// Note that ignoring HelloRequest messages may cause the connection to stall
// if the server waits for the renegotiation to complete.
//
// If set to |ssl_renegotiate_explicit|, |SSL_read| and |SSL_peek| calls which
// encounter a HelloRequest will pause with |SSL_ERROR_WANT_RENEGOTIATE|.
// |SSL_write| will continue to work while paused. The caller may call
// |SSL_renegotiate| to begin the renegotiation at a later point. This mode may
// be used if callers wish to eagerly call |SSL_peek| without triggering a
// renegotiation.
//
// If configuration shedding is enabled (see |SSL_set_shed_handshake_config|),
// configuration is released if, at any point after the handshake, renegotiation
// is disabled. It is not possible to switch from disabling renegotiation to
// enabling it on a given connection. Callers that condition renegotiation on,
// e.g., ALPN must enable renegotiation before the handshake and conditionally
// disable it afterwards.
//
// There is no support in BoringSSL for initiating renegotiations as a client
// or server.</doc>
