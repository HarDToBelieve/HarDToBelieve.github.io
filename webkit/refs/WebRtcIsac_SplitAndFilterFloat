 * This function creates low-pass and high-pass decimated versions of part of
 the input signal, and part of the signal in the input &apos;lookahead buffer&apos;.

 INPUTS:
 in: a length FRAMESAMPLES array of input samples
 prefiltdata: input data structure containing the filterbank states
 and lookahead samples from the previous encoding
 iteration.
 OUTPUTS:
 LP: a FRAMESAMPLES_HALF array of low-pass filtered samples that
 have been phase equalized.  The first QLOOKAHEAD samples are
 based on the samples in the two prefiltdata-&gt;INLABUFx arrays
 each of length QLOOKAHEAD.
 The remaining FRAMESAMPLES_HALF-QLOOKAHEAD samples are based
 on the first FRAMESAMPLES_HALF-QLOOKAHEAD samples of the input
 array in[].
 HP: a FRAMESAMPLES_HALF array of high-pass filtered samples that
 have been phase equalized.  The first QLOOKAHEAD samples are
 based on the samples in the two prefiltdata-&gt;INLABUFx arrays
 each of length QLOOKAHEAD.
 The remaining FRAMESAMPLES_HALF-QLOOKAHEAD samples are based
 on the first FRAMESAMPLES_HALF-QLOOKAHEAD samples of the input
 array in[].

 LP_la: a FRAMESAMPLES_HALF array of low-pass filtered samples.
 These samples are not phase equalized. They are computed
 from the samples in the in[] array.
 HP_la: a FRAMESAMPLES_HALF array of high-pass filtered samples
 that are not phase equalized. They are computed from
 the in[] vector.
 prefiltdata: this input data structure&apos;s filterbank state and
 lookahead sample buffers are updated for the next
 encoding iteration.
