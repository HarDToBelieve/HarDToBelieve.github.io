<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/ANGLE/src/common/third_party/xxhash/xxhash.c' l='559'>/*! Default XXH result types are basic unsigned 32 and 64 bits.
*   The canonical representation follows human-readable write convention, aka big-endian (large digits first).
*   These functions allow transformation of hash result into and from its canonical format.
*   This way, hash values can be written into a file or buffer, remaining comparable across different systems.
