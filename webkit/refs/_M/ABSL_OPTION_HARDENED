//
// This option enables a &quot;hardened&quot; build in release mode (in this context,
// release mode is defined as a build where the `NDEBUG` macro is defined).
//
// A value of 0 means that &quot;hardened&quot; mode is not enabled.
//
// A value of 1 means that &quot;hardened&quot; mode is enabled.
//
// Hardened builds have additional security checks enabled when `NDEBUG` is
// defined. Defining `NDEBUG` is normally used to turn `assert()` macro into a
// no-op, as well as disabling other bespoke program consistency checks. By
// defining ABSL_OPTION_HARDENED to 1, a select set of checks remain enabled in
// release mode. These checks guard against programming errors that may lead to
// security vulnerabilities. In release mode, when one of these programming
// errors is encountered, the program will immediately abort, possibly without
// any attempt at logging.
//
// The checks enabled by this option are not free; they do incur runtime cost.
//
// The checks enabled by this option are always active when `NDEBUG` is not
// defined, even in the case when ABSL_OPTION_HARDENED is defined to 0. The
// checks enabled by this option may abort the program in a different way and
// log additional information when `NDEBUG` is not defined.</doc>
