<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/base.h' l='190'>// BORINGSSL_API_VERSION is a positive integer that increments as BoringSSL
// changes over time. The value itself is not meaningful. It will be incremented
// whenever is convenient to coordinate an API change with consumers. This will
// not denote any special point in development.
//
// A consumer may use this symbol in the preprocessor to temporarily build
// against multiple revisions of BoringSSL at the same time. It is not
// recommended to do so for longer than is necessary.</doc>
