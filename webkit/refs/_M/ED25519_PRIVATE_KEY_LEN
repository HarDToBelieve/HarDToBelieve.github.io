//
// Ed25519 is a signature scheme using a twisted-Edwards curve that is
// birationally equivalent to curve25519.
//
// Note that, unlike RFC 8032&apos;s formulation, our private key representation
// includes a public key suffix to make multiple key signing operations with the
// same key more efficient. The RFC 8032 private key is referred to in this
// implementation as the &quot;seed&quot; and is the first 32 bytes of our private key.</doc>
