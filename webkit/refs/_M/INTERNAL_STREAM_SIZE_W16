 * - The encoder and decoder bitstream containers are of different size because
 *   old iSAC limited the encoded bitstream to 600 bytes. But newer versions
 *   restrict to shorter bitstream.
 * - We add 10 bytes of guards to the internal bitstream container. The reason
 *   is that entropy decoder might read few bytes (3 according to our
 *   observations) more than the actual size of the bitstream. To avoid reading
 *   outside memory, in rare occasion of full-size bitstream we add 10 bytes
 *   of guard. */</doc>
