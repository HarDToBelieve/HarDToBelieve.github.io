 * __Userspace__ flags like M_NOWAIT are defined in malloc.h
 * Flags like these are used in functions like uma_zalloc()
 * but don&apos;t have an equivalent in userland umem
 * Flags specifying how an allocation should be made.
 *
 * The flag to use is as follows:
 * - M_DONTWAIT or M_NOWAIT from an interrupt handler to not block allocation.
 * - M_WAIT or M_WAITOK or M_TRYWAIT from wherever it is safe to block.
 *
 * M_DONTWAIT/M_NOWAIT means that we will not block the thread explicitly and
 * if we cannot allocate immediately we may return NULL, whereas
 * M_WAIT/M_WAITOK/M_TRYWAIT means that if we cannot allocate resources we
 * will block until they are available, and thus never return NULL.
 *
 * XXX Eventually just phase this out to use M_WAITOK/M_NOWAIT.
