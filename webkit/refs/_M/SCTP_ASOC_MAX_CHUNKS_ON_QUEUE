 * Maxmium number of chunks a single association can have on it. Note that
 * this is a squishy number since the count can run over this if the user
 * sends a large message down .. the fragmented chunks don&apos;t count until
 * AFTER the message is on queue.. it would be the next send that blocks
 * things. This number will get tuned up at boot in the sctp_init and use the
 * number of clusters as a base. This way high bandwidth environments will
 * not get impacted by the lower bandwidth sending a bunch of 1 byte chunks
