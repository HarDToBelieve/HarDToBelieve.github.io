 * other symbols. These values are used by other libraries to identify
 * cryptographic primitives.
 *
 * A separate objects library, obj.h, provides functions for converting between
 * nids and object identifiers. However it depends on large internal tables with
 * the encodings of every nid defined. Consumers concerned with binary size
 * should instead embed the encodings of the few consumed OIDs and compare
 * against those.
 *
 * These values should not be used outside of a single process; they are not
 * stable identifiers. */</doc>
