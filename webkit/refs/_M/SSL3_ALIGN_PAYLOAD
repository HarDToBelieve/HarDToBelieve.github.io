<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/ssl3.h' l='211'>// Some will argue that this increases memory footprint, but it&apos;s not actually
// true. Point is that malloc has to return at least 64-bit aligned pointers,
// meaning that allocating 5 bytes wastes 3 bytes in either case. Suggested
// pre-gaping simply moves these wasted bytes from the end of allocated region
// to its front, but makes data payload aligned, which improves performance.</doc>
