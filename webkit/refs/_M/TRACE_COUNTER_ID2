<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/ANGLE/src/third_party/trace_event/trace_event.h' l='278'>// Records the values of a multi-parted counter called &quot;name&quot; immediately.
// The UI will treat value1 and value2 as parts of a whole, displaying their
// values as a stacked-bar chart.
// - category and name strings must have application lifetime (statics or
//   literals). They may not include &quot; chars.
// - |id| is used to disambiguate counters with the same name. It must either
//   be a pointer or an integer value up to 64 bits. If it&apos;s a pointer, the bits
//   will be xored with a hash of the process ID so that the same pointer on
//   two different processes will not collide.</doc>
