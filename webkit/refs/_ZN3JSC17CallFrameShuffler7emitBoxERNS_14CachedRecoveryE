<doc f='webkit/Source/JavaScriptCore/jit/CallFrameShuffler.h' l='198'>// &quot;box&quot; is arguably a bad name here. The meaning is that after
    // calling emitBox(), your ensure that subsequently calling
    // emitStore() will be able to store the value without additional
    // transformation. In particular, this is a no-op for constants,
    // and is a complete no-op on 32bits since any unboxed value can
    // still be stored by storing the payload and a statically known
    // tag.</doc>
