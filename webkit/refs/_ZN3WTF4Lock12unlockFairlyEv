    // sections, this is much slower than unlock(). For long critical sections, unlock() will learn
    // to be fair anyway. However, if you plan to relock the lock right after unlocking and you want
    // to ensure that some other thread runs in the meantime, this is probably the function you
    // want.</doc>
