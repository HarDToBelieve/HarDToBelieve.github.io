  // |received_packets|, storing FEC packets internally, and move
  // media packets to |recovered_packets|. The recovered list will be
  // sorted by ascending sequence number and have duplicates removed.
  // The function should be called as new packets arrive, and
  // |recovered_packets| will be progressively assembled with each call.
  // When the function returns, |received_packets| will be empty.
  //
  // The caller will allocate packets submitted through |received_packets|.
  // The function will handle allocation of recovered packets.

  // Input:  received_packets   List of new received packets, of type
  //                            ReceivedPacket, belonging to a single
  //                            frame. At output the list will be empty,

  // Output: recovered_packets  List of recovered media packets, of type
