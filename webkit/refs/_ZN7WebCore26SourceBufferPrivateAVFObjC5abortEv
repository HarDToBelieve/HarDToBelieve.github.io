// https://w3c.github.io/media-source/#dfn-buffer-append
// which is then followed by a call to resetParserState
// as per https://w3c.github.io/media-source/#dom-sourcebuffer-abort
// However due to our asynchronous design this causes inherent difficulties.
// The SourceBuffe&apos;s abortIfUpdating method would have already cancelled any

// As the spec behaviour is non deterministic anyway, we instead process all
// pending frames found in the input buffer.</doc>
