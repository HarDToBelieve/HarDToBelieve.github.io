//
// Note: Although the struct is exposed, mutating an |ASN1_OBJECT| is only
// permitted when initializing it. The library maintains a table of static
// |ASN1_OBJECT|s, which may be referenced by non-const |ASN1_OBJECT| pointers.
// Code which receives an |ASN1_OBJECT| pointer externally must assume it is
// immutable, even if the pointer is not const.
