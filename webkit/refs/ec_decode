  This can then be fed into the probability model to determine what that
   symbol is, and the additional frequency information required to advance to
   the next symbol.
  This function cannot be called more than once without a corresponding call to
   ec_dec_update(), or decoding will not proceed correctly.
  _ft: The total frequency of the symbols in the alphabet the next symbol was
        encoded with.
  Return: A cumulative frequency representing the encoded symbol.
          If the cumulative frequency of all the symbols before the one that
           was encoded was fl, and the cumulative frequency of all the symbols
           up to and including the one encoded is fh, then the returned value
           will fall in the range [fl,fh).*/</doc>
