<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/x509.h' l='1006'>// i2d_X509_tbs serializes the TBSCertificate portion of |x509|. If |outp| is
// NULL, nothing is written. Otherwise, if |*outp| is not NULL, the result is
// written to |*outp|, which must have enough space available, and |*outp| is
// advanced just past the output. If |outp| is non-NULL and |*outp| is NULL, it
// sets |*outp| to a newly-allocated buffer containing the result. The caller is
// responsible for releasing the buffer with |OPENSSL_free|. In all cases, this
// function returns the number of bytes in the result, whether written or not,
// or a negative value on error.
//
// This function preserves the original encoding of the TBSCertificate and may
// not reflect modifications made to |x509|. It may be used to manually verify
// the signature of an existing certificate. To generate certificates, use
// |i2d_re_X509_tbs| instead.</doc>
