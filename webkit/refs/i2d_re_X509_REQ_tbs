<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/boringssl/src/include/openssl/x509.h' l='1179'>// i2d_re_X509_REQ_tbs serializes the CertificationRequestInfo (see RFC2986)
// portion of |req|. If |outp| is NULL, nothing is written. Otherwise, if
// |*outp| is not NULL, the result is written to |*outp|, which must have enough
// space available, and |*outp| is advanced just past the output. If |outp| is
// non-NULL and |*outp| is NULL, it sets |*outp| to a newly-allocated buffer
// containing the result. The caller is responsible for releasing the buffer
// with |OPENSSL_free|. In all cases, this function returns the number of bytes
// in the result, whether written or not, or a negative value on error.
//
// This function re-encodes the CertificationRequestInfo and may not reflect
// |req|&apos;s original encoding. It may be used to manually generate a signature
// for a new certificate request.</doc>
