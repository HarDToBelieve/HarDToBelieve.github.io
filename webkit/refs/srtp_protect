 * @brief srtp_protect() is the Secure RTP sender-side packet processing
 * function.
 *
 * The function call srtp_protect(ctx, rtp_hdr, len_ptr) applies SRTP
 * protection to the RTP packet rtp_hdr (which has length *len_ptr) using
 * the SRTP context ctx.  If srtp_err_status_ok is returned, then rtp_hdr
 * points to the resulting SRTP packet and *len_ptr is the number of
 * octets in that packet; otherwise, no assumptions should be made
 * about the value of either data elements.
 *
 * The sequence numbers of the RTP packets presented to this function
 * need not be consecutive, but they @b must be out of order by less
 * than 2^15 = 32,768 packets.
 *
 * @warning This function assumes that it can write the authentication
 * tag into the location in memory immediately following the RTP
 * packet, and assumes that the RTP packet is aligned on a 32-bit
 * boundary.
 *
 * @warning This function assumes that it can write SRTP_MAX_TRAILER_LEN
 * into the location in memory immediately following the RTP packet.
 * Callers MUST ensure that this much writable memory is available in
 * the buffer that holds the RTP packet.
 *
 * @param ctx is the SRTP context to use in processing the packet.
 *
 * @param rtp_hdr is a pointer to the RTP packet (before the call); after
 * the function returns, it points to the srtp packet.
 *
 * @param len_ptr is a pointer to the length in octets of the complete
 * RTP packet (header and body) before the function call, and of the
 * complete SRTP packet after the call, if srtp_err_status_ok was returned.
 * Otherwise, the value of the data to which it points is undefined.
 *
 * @return
 *    - srtp_err_status_ok            no problems
 *    - srtp_err_status_replay_fail   rtp sequence number was non-increasing
 *    - @e other                 failure in cryptographic mechanisms
