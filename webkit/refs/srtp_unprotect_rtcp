 * @brief srtp_unprotect_rtcp() is the Secure RTCP receiver-side packet
 * processing function.
 *
 * The function call srtp_unprotect_rtcp(ctx, srtp_hdr, len_ptr)
 * verifies the Secure RTCP protection of the SRTCP packet pointed to
 * by srtcp_hdr (which has length *len_ptr), using the SRTP session
 * context ctx.  If srtp_err_status_ok is returned, then srtcp_hdr points
 * to the resulting RTCP packet and *len_ptr is the number of octets
 * in that packet; otherwise, no assumptions should be made about the
 * value of either data elements.
 *
 * @warning This function assumes that the SRTCP packet is aligned on a
 * 32-bit boundary.
 *
 * @param ctx is a pointer to the srtp_t which applies to the
 * particular packet.
 *
 * @param srtcp_hdr is a pointer to the header of the SRTCP packet
 * (before the call).  After the function returns, it points to the
 * rtp packet if srtp_err_status_ok was returned; otherwise, the value of
 * the data to which it points is undefined.
 *
 * @param pkt_octet_len is a pointer to the length in octets of the
 * complete SRTCP packet (header and body) before the function call,
 * and of the complete rtp packet after the call, if srtp_err_status_ok was
 * returned.  Otherwise, the value of the data to which it points is
 * undefined.
 *
 * @return
 *    - srtp_err_status_ok          if the RTCP packet is valid.
 *    - srtp_err_status_auth_fail   if the SRTCP packet failed the message
 *                             authentication check.
 *    - srtp_err_status_replay_fail if the SRTCP packet is a replay (e.g. has
 *                             already been processed and accepted).
 *    - [other]  if there has been an error in the cryptographic mechanisms.
