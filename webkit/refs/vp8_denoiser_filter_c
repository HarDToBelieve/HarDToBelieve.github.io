 * The filter function was modified to reduce the computational complexity.
 * Step 1:
 * Instead of applying tap coefficients for each pixel, we calculated the
 * pixel adjustments vs. pixel diff value ahead of time.
 *     adjustment = filtered_value - current_raw
 *                = (filter_coefficient * diff + 128) &gt;&gt; 8
 * where
 *     filter_coefficient = (255 &lt;&lt; 8) / (256 + ((absdiff * 330) &gt;&gt; 3));
 *     filter_coefficient += filter_coefficient /
 *                           (3 + motion_magnitude_adjustment);
 *     filter_coefficient is clamped to 0 ~ 255.
 *
 * Step 2:
 * The adjustment vs. diff curve becomes flat very quick when diff increases.
 * This allowed us to use only several levels to approximate the curve without
 * changing the filtering algorithm too much.
 * The adjustments were further corrected by checking the motion magnitude.
 * The levels used are:
 * diff       adjustment w/o motion correction   adjustment w/ motion correction
 * [-255, -16]           -6                                   -7
 * [-15, -8]             -4                                   -5
 * [-7, -4]              -3                                   -4
 * [-3, 3]               diff                                 diff
 * [4, 7]                 3                                    4
 * [8, 15]                4                                    5
 * [16, 255]              6                                    7
