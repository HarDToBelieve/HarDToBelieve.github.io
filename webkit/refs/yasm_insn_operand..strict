<doc f='webkit/Source/ThirdParty/libwebrtc/Source/third_party/yasm/libyasm/insn.h' l='119'>/** Nonzero if strict.  Used for &quot;strict foo&quot; in NASM.
     * This is used to inhibit optimization on otherwise &quot;sized&quot; values.
     * For example, the user may just want to be explicit with the size on
     * &quot;push dword 4&quot;, but not actually want to force the immediate size to
     * 4 bytes (rather wanting the optimizer to optimize it down to 1 byte as
     * though &quot;dword&quot; was not specified).  To indicate the immediate should
     * actually be forced to 4 bytes, the user needs to write
     * &quot;push strict dword 4&quot;, which sets this flag.
